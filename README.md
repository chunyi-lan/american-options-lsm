# American Options Valuation: Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSM)

## Description
This project implements the Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) approach to value American options. It provides a flexible and efficient method to handle early exercise features of American options. The project is fully implemented in MATLAB.

## Features
- Simulates American option pricing using the LSM method.
- Flexible configuration of parameters such as volatility, risk-free rate, and strike price.
- Implemented in MATLAB for numerical analysis.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB.

## Project Structure
- `solve_BS_American_LSM.m`: Example input files
- `check_BS_American_LSM.m`: Main script for option valuation
