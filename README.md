# American Options Valuation: Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC)

## Description
This project implements the Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) approach to value American options. It provides a flexible and efficient method to handle early exercise features of American options. The project is fully implemented in MATLAB.

## Features
- Valuation of American options using LSMC simulation.
- Supports flexible underlying asset dynamics.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB.

## Project Structure
- solve_BS_American_LSM.m: Example input files
- check_BS_American_LSM.m: Main script for option valuation

## Acknowledgements
- Inspired by academic works on Least-Squares Monte Carlo methods.
